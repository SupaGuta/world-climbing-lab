# Data dictionary

Per-table column reference for the SQLite warehouse at `data/wcl.sqlite`. The
schema's source of truth is [`src/wcl_data/db/schema.py`](https://github.com/SupaGuta/world-climbing-lab/blob/main/src/wcl_data/db/schema.py);
this folder explains what each column *means*, what's in it, and what's
missing.

For the *why* of the schema design (single SQLite file, staleness model,
transactional boundary on competitions) see
[`../architecture/ingestion/database-and-schema.md`](../architecture/ingestion/database-and-schema.md)
and the relevant ADRs.

## Tables

- [seasons](seasons.md) — top of the entity tree
- [season-leagues](season-leagues.md) — (season × league) junction
- [events](events.md) — competition events with city/country/date
- [competitions](competitions.md) — (event × discipline × category) triples
- [athletes](athletes.md) — athlete profiles
- [results](results.md) — (competition × athlete × overall rank)
- [category-rounds](category-rounds.md) — phases of a competition (qualif / semi / final)
- [round-stages](round-stages.md) — sub-stages of a round (speed-final heats, combined sub-disciplines)
- [routes](routes.md) — individual climbing routes / boulders / speed lanes
- [round-results](round-results.md) — (round × athlete) per-phase rank + score
- [stage-results](stage-results.md) — (stage × athlete) per-stage detail
- [ascents](ascents.md) — (route × athlete × stage) per-route performance detail
- [cup-rankings](cup-rankings.md) — (athlete × cup × discipline) season-end overall standings
- [reference-tables](reference-tables.md) — `leagues`, `disciplines`, `categories`

## Conventions

### Identity columns

Every entity carries two IDs:

- **`id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY** — local row PK assigned by SQLite. Used by
  foreign keys.
- **`ifsc_id` INTEGER UNIQUE** — the IFSC API's ID, used to build URLs like
  `/seasons/{ifsc_id}`. Always populated.

Foreign keys reference `id`, never `ifsc_id`. The one place this rule bends:
`competitions.ifsc_id` is *not* globally unique across events, which is why
that table uses `UNIQUE (event_id, ifsc_id)` instead of a unique constraint
on `ifsc_id` alone.

### Units

- **`height`, `arm_span`** — centimetres (INTEGER). Self-reported on World Climbing; see
  coverage caveats per table.
- **`gender`** — INTEGER. `0` = male, `1` = female, NULL = unknown / not in
  the data.
- **`birthday`** — TEXT in `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO date), or NULL.
- **`date_start`, `date_end`** — TEXT in `YYYY-MM-DD`. No time component.
- **`last_fetched_at`** — TEXT in `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` (ISO-8601 UTC with
  literal `Z`). Lexicographically sortable.
- **Booleans (`events.is_paraclimbing`)** — INTEGER `0` / `1`. SQLite has
  no native bool. (The v3-era `athletes.is_paraclimbing` was dropped in v4;
  use `athletes.paraclimbing_sport_class IS NOT NULL` instead. See
  [ADR 0009](../decisions/0009-athletes-payload-expansion.md).)
- **Country** — every table with a country carries two columns:
  - `country` — raw federation code (mix of ISO3 like `FRA`/`USA`/`JPN` and
    IFSC/IOC variants like `GER`/`SUI`/`NED`/`INA`/`IRI`/`MAS`/`SIN`).
    Source of truth for "what the federation said".
  - `country_iso3` — canonical ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 only, derived via the
    static IFSC→ISO3 map. Use this for joins with external datasets
    (Olympics rosters, geo-coded city tables, country demographics, …).
    NULL iff `country` is NULL.

  See [ADR 0008](../decisions/0008-country-iso3-sibling-column.md) for the
  dual-column rationale and the full mapping.

### NULL semantics

NULL means *we don't know*, not *zero* or *false*. For hydratable tables,
`last_fetched_at IS NULL` specifically means the row is a discovery skeleton —
inserted by a parent fetcher but never filled in. The next `hydrate` /
`refresh` / `pull-new` will pick it up.

For non-identity fields (height, birthday, photo_url, city, country): NULL
almost always means *the World Climbing API doesn't have it either*, not that the
parser dropped it. See the per-table pages for coverage stats.

### Recomputing coverage

The coverage percentages cited in each table page are accurate as of
2026-05-23 but will drift. To recompute for any column:

```bash
python -c "import sqlite3; c = sqlite3.connect('data/wcl.sqlite'); \
  total = c.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM athletes WHERE last_fetched_at IS NOT NULL').fetchone()[0]; \
  populated = c.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM athletes WHERE last_fetched_at IS NOT NULL AND birthday IS NOT NULL').fetchone()[0]; \
  print(f'{populated}/{total} = {100*populated/total:.1f}%')"
```

Adapt by swapping the table and column names. Always condition on
`last_fetched_at IS NOT NULL` so unhydrated skeletons don't deflate the
denominator.

## What's *not* in the warehouse

For the full Layer 0 surface contract (stable tables, guarantees, hors-scope),
see [`../architecture/ingestion/layer-0-surface.md`](../architecture/ingestion/layer-0-surface.md).
The bullets below summarize the main exclusions.

- **Startlists and starting orders.** The API exposes
  `/api/v1/routes/{id}/startlist` and per-stage starting orders, but they're
  not currently ingested.
- **Judge / route-setter data.** Not consumed.
- **Live ranking deltas.** Each competition stores its final ranking only.
- **Anything older than World Climbing's API coverage.** The earliest seasons date from
  the late 1990s; pre-API archive results aren't here.
