# Documentation

Docs for `wcl_data`. The root [`README.md`](https://github.com/SupaGuta/world-climbing-lab/blob/main/README.md) is the *user*
guide (install, CLI reference, `.env` variables). What lives here is
everything else — the **why** behind the design, the per-table data
reference, recipes for common tasks, the Python API, and operational
procedures.

This tree is append-only. New layers get new folders; existing files are
edited in place as code changes.

## Where to start by goal

- **"I want to use this thing."** Start with
  [cli-cookbook/setup.md](cli-cookbook/setup.md), then
  [cli-cookbook/daily-use.md](cli-cookbook/daily-use.md). When you need
  to query the data, jump to
  [cli-cookbook/exports.md](cli-cookbook/exports.md) or
  [cli-cookbook/custom-queries.md](cli-cookbook/custom-queries.md).
- **"What's in the database?"** [data-dictionary/](data-dictionary/README.md) —
  one file per table, with coverage stats and gotchas.
- **"I want to script against it."** [python-api/README.md](python-api/README.md)
  → the three reference pages.
- **"Something's broken."**
  [cli-cookbook/troubleshooting.md](cli-cookbook/troubleshooting.md) for
  "I ran X and got Y," [operations/recovery.md](operations/recovery.md)
  for procedure-level recovery.
- **"How do I keep credentials / logs / backups healthy?"**
  [operations/](operations/README.md) — one page per topic.
- **"I want to extend the code."** [contributing.md](contributing.md)
  → [architecture/ingestion/overview.md](architecture/ingestion/overview.md) → the relevant
  architecture page → the relevant ADR.
- **"Why is it shaped this way?"**
  [architecture/ingestion/](architecture/ingestion/overview.md) for the design,
  [decisions/](decisions/README.md) for the trade-offs each design choice locked
  in.

## Where to start by role

- **New contributor:** [contributing.md](contributing.md) →
  [architecture/ingestion/overview.md](architecture/ingestion/overview.md)
- **Trying to extend ingestion:**
  [architecture/ingestion/ingestion-pipeline.md](architecture/ingestion/ingestion-pipeline.md)
  → [contributing.md](contributing.md) (add-a-fetcher section)
- **Touching the DB layer:**
  [architecture/ingestion/database-and-schema.md](architecture/ingestion/database-and-schema.md)
  + ADRs [0002](decisions/0002-streaming-writes.md),
  [0005](decisions/0005-transactional-boundary-on-competitions.md)
- **Touching the HTTP layer:**
  [architecture/ingestion/api-client.md](architecture/ingestion/api-client.md) + ADR
  [0003](decisions/0003-selective-4xx-skip-retry.md)
- **Downstream consumer (notebooks, ML pipeline):**
  [data-dictionary/](data-dictionary/README.md) →
  [python-api/README.md](python-api/README.md)
