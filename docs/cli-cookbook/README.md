# CLI cookbook

Task-oriented recipes for the `python -m wcl_data` CLI. Grouped by intent —
find the section that matches what you're trying to do.

For the CLI reference (all flags, all options) see the root
[`README.md`](https://github.com/SupaGuta/world-climbing-lab/blob/main/README.md). For the *why* behind each command's
behavior, see [`../architecture/ingestion/`](../architecture/ingestion/overview.md) and the
[ADRs](../decisions/README.md).

## Sections

- [setup.md](setup.md) — first-time install, credentials, initial populate
- [daily-use.md](daily-use.md) — `pull-new`, `refresh`, `hydrate`, smoke
  testing, tuning concurrency
- [exports.md](exports.md) — `export` to CSV, then filter with **pandas** or
  **sqlite3 CLI** ("women's lead only," "Chamonix 2019," "top-10 by country")
- [custom-queries.md](custom-queries.md) — SQL one-liners against the
  warehouse for ad-hoc questions
- [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) — "I ran X and got Y, what now"
  for common failure modes
- [exit-codes.md](exit-codes.md) — exit-code taxonomy (0 success, 3 DB lock,
  4 missing creds, 5 mid-run auth failure, …) for wrapper scripts and CI
